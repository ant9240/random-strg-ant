# random-strg-ant

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a â€œgit initâ€ there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-strg-ant
```

# Usage

```bash
 random-strg-ant
```

# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [random-strg-ant](https://github.com/ant9240/random-strg-ant.git)
